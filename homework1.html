    <hr/>Lists<hr/>
    <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
    <p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>They are useful for displaying list of staff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I am gonna put another list here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
<p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>
<div>
  <ol>
    <li>Decide if it is an ordered list or not</li>
    <li>If it's not a ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
      <ul>
        <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
          <ol>
            <li>curveball! You can nest list inside each pver</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You've got this! I believe in you</li>
  </ol>
</div>
